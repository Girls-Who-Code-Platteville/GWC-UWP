A meta-repository to help navigate the repos and resources of Girls Who Code at UW-Platteville.

<h2>About Us</h2>
Founded by Professor Emerita Donna M Gavin and undergraduate women computer science and software engineering majors attending the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at the University of Wisconsin - Platteville, our Girls Who Code Club seeks to provide a collaborative and supportive environment for middle and high school women of all skill levels and backgrounds interested in learning how to code.

Due to the expertise of our undergraduate student Facilitators, our club curriculum is focused on the Python programming language. Participants learn core coding concepts and implement their new skills in a capstone project of their choosing.
